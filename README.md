## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alert90/Avo.git
cd Avo


I can make this even more **visually striking** with a **banner image** at the top and custom badges for **Laravel** and **Next.js**.  

Do you want me to make the README **with a branded banner** so it really pops on GitHub? That would make the repo look like a pro SaaS project.
